 *   paying      Checkout is open; the runner is paying

 *   paid        confirmed
 *   failed      declined, window closed -- can try again
 *   error       could not start -- can try again
 *   processing  paid, bank still confirming (UPI) -- check again, do NOT pay again
 *   unverified  paid, our check could not run -- check again, do NOT pay again
 *   refund      paid, but the entry could not take it -- contact organisers
 *   expired     reservation lapsed -- start again
 *   offline     online payment was switched off -- organisers will collect
 *   cancelling  releasing the reservation at the runner's request
 *
 * `processing` and `unverified` deliberately offer no Pay button. The money
